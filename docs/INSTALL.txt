** PyNetCCTV Installation Instructions **

NOTE: This software is for Linux.

1. How to install the Django application

1.1 First install Django (there are good docs on djangoproject.com)

1.2 Install the PyNetCCTV application into Django:

    - cd <django_project> #(where the settings.py file is, etc.)
    - ln -s <where you put PyNetCCTV>/PyNetCCTVDjangoManager PyNetCCTVDjangoManager

    - #add 'PyNetCCTVDjangoManager' to the INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
    - #uncomment the relevant line to enable the admin in INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
    - python manage.py syncdb
    - python manage.py validate

    - cd static #(or wherever your MEDIA_ROOT points to in settings.py)
    - ln -s <where you put PyNetCCTV>/PyNetCCTVDjangoManager/static cctv

    - Add the follow to urlpatterns in urls.py:
        (r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        (r'^cctv/', include('PyNetCCTVDjangoManager.urls')),
    - and uncomment these two lines at the top:
        from django.contrib import admin
        admin.autodiscover()

    - #Start your Django server (using "python manage.py runserver" or however you've configured Django) and have a look in e.g. http://localhost:8000/admin and http://localhost:8000/cctv .

1.3 Set up the snapshot daemon
    - cd <where you put PyNetCCTV>/SnapshotDaemon/
    - cp config.in config
    - #Edit config so the paths are correct for your system

    - The simplest way to run the daemon is to use cron as the django user:
    - crontab -e #Then add this line (don't forget the newline at the end):
      0 * * * * (cd <where you put PyNetCCTV>/SnapshotDaemon/ && ./run_daemon.sh > output)


That's it. It should work, but if there are any problems please raise an issue or email ed@rameus.org.uk.
